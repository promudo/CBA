An Excel project that uses Live Exchange Rates data using an API from abokifx.com for a dynamic solution that requires accurate material cost computation for contracts involving multiple currencies, providing crucial insights for a company dealing with diverse international transactions.

Through the implementation of Data Validation with List, I have ensured data correctness and precision, allowing for seamless data entry and eliminating potential errors. The tool's dynamic nature ensures that the currency rates are automatically updated, providing real-time accuracy in material cost calculations even amid fluctuating exchange rates.

In adherence to industry best practices, I have meticulously followed a comprehensive sheet naming guideline, facilitating easy navigation and enhancing the user experience. The organized structure of the Excel project optimizes data management, promoting efficiency in handling complex financial information.
